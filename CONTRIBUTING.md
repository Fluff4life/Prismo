### Reporting Bugs

If you encounter a bug while using Prismo, we encourage you to report it. Here's how:

1. Check the [Issues](https://github.com/PrismoDevelopment/Prismo/issues) to see if the bug has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea to improve Prismo, we want to hear it! Here's how to propose new features or improvements:

1. Check the [Issues](https://github.com/PrismoDevelopment/Prismo/issues) to see if someone else has already suggested the same thing. If they have, you can add your own ideas in the comments.
2. If it's a new idea, [open a new issue](https://github.com/PrismoDevelopment/Prismo/issues/new). Be sure to include a **clear title and description** of your proposed enhancement, why you think it would be useful, and how it should work.

### Pull Requests

If you know how to code, we welcome you to submit pull requests!

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your features / fixes.
3. Push your changes to the branch.
4. Submit a pull request to the main repository.

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Title must reflect what changes are inside the pull request.

We'll review your pull request and get back to you as soon as we can.
